# Commodore-64-Atari-C64-Controller-PCB


Summary

That PCB allows you to convert Chinese controllers like one on the photo to be compatible with C64 and other devices with Atari controller port. It should work with all of controller types and with all amounts of buttons, however I designed it for the one on the photo and for different ones you might need to drill mount holes.

Of course you will need:

Chinese controller;
Membrane and buttons;
D type plug;
Cable with appropriate amount of conductors;
And just slap 'em together.

!!!!!!
Second button does not work, I'll fix it later after testing. The documentation about 2nd button is not very clear on the internet.
